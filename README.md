# Data Analytics Project on Technology Trends
This project explored the dynamic landscape of technology, focusing on several areas such as programming languages, web frameworks, and more. It seeks to answer the following questions:

• Which technologies are currently the most popular, and how has their popularity changed?

• What are the underlying implications?

Data was collected through API and webscraping from Github and Stack Overflow. It was then analyzed by creating visualizations and data frames.
